### The EV3 band is finally ready to become reality.
<p>With a planned outline for the band and being familiar with the materials and the software, I began constructing the the structure for the guitar. </p>
##### The structure of the guitar servers to be the “hands” that play the guitar. When building the structure there are a few aspects and details the must be considered:

<li>The structure must be stable:</li>
<ul>The structure cannot be loose and move around when the motors are operating. With repeated shaking of the structure, there is a possibility of falling apart. </ul>
<li>The arrangement of the piece must allow for a varied range of motion</li>
<ul>This point directly relates to the part on the neck of  the guitar that will press down on frets and act as fingers. Additionally the arm that will strum the strings needs to be assembled so that it can move freely and perform the proper strum. Similarly, like joints on a human the EV3 robot will mimic this in order to reach the same movement. </ul>


<p>Keeping these ideas in mind, I began designing the base on the lower part of the guitar's body. The base is made up of a variety of beams and connectors in order to provide stability.
![Beams](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Froboticsmbsskl.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F02%2F11%2Fhow-do-you-recognize-beams%2F&psig=AOvVaw3IyrI-jo69nF19a5FKj2Qb&ust=1581386519372000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLjX24HyxecCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

As I added more pieces together, I ran into trouble. After building a section of the base that went across the body of the guitar, I reached a dead end. My next step was to build upwards but I did not  know how to do that with the beams. As a result I turned to google to find people who had done a similar project. On youtube I ran into the user TECHNICally Possible who shares a video on his attempt at this project.<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN-7cMjmFv0">Video </a>

In the video, he explains and shows his arrangement of pieces. Pausing the video to see closely how he connects his parts, I noticed his use of a frame to elevate the structure.  After seeing this, I realized why I didn't know how to proceed. By using just simple beams ( what I thought initially) was not satisfactory because there would be no support and the setup would fall.

### Summary
<p>
In regards to the Engineering Design Process, I’m on step 5: creating a prototype. But even within this step, I am constantly going back and performing mini-cycle through the entire process: defining my issue  researching, brainstorming, planning, creating, and testing. These past few weeks I began building my larger prototype but as I go I find myself dealing with smaller problems, such as my issue with elevation of my structure. As I continue to go through my designing process I will run into more mini problems that will require going through the EDP.

But my larger prototype step is far from finished. I still have many additions to make in order for the EV3 to play a song. The next step for me is to add the motors. For my EV3 Band, I will need a Large Motor and Medium Motor. According to Lego the Large Motor is slower but more powerful than the medium Motor. As a result, it'll be up to me to determine where each motor belongs.  <a href =https://counties.agrilife.org/gillespie/files/2015/04/EV3-Motors-Sensors-Explained.pdf >Lego </a>


The recent weeks have shown me the importance of paying attention to small details. It may seem easy to put lego pieces together to make a coherent structure but logical reasoning is definitely a skill that I am using now when building. After realizing the use of the Frame to make my layout standing and stable, it made perfect sense and was completely logical. Since the Frame is built into a square shape it'll have much more support than the single Beam. As I continue to make my EV3 Band I am looking to first make a minimum viable product and then perfect it as I go.
