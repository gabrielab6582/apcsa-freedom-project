Hello! You've reached the first entry of my Freedom Project


#### What tools use for my indpendent study project?

Before even deciding on a tool or a final idea, I knew that my project would
incorporate my background knowledge of music and playing the guitar and the basics of
piano.

 When looking for a tool to use for my Freedom Project, I ran into a program that directly
 related to music called EarSketch. This is a program that creates music through
 the use of Javascript and/or Python. I thought this was going to be the topic I choose.
 However, my teacher, Mr.Mueller encouraged the class to continue looking.

 I continued my research and ran into the idea of robotics. Robotics works
 with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots or
 computer systems to control, provide sensory reaction, and information processing.

 At school there are already LEGO EV3 robots. I took the time to research and browser some
 ideas for projects using the EV3. Looking at how the robot works I became discouraged because
 I could not seem to find something that I found eye catching. Then I found a youtube video
 of the EV3 robot  playing the guitar, this sparked an idea in me.  What if I made a band from
 one guitar and an EV3 robot?

 This is exactly what my project will consist of:
 <b>One guitar</b> The EV3 will strum the guitar, hit the base of the guitar for a bass and make sounds
    that represent a melody of a song
