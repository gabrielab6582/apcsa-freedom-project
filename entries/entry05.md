### Dum-ba-badump
<p>In these past few weeks the pieces of the EV3 Band  have been finally coming together. In the process my plan of action has also been slightly altered in order to fit my schedule. Because I did not have the chance to add motors to my guitar structure during class. I took it upon myself to take the necessary lego pieces and work on the drum portion of the project at home. My brainstorming process looked like this: </p>

<li>Deciding on the type of motor: A motor that would provide a range of up and down motion is crucial to make this drum work. It is meant to mimic the motion of an arm hitting a drum. The large motor makes this possible because its rotation is perpendicular to the wing of the motor, which promotes that arm swinging motion. Additionally the large motor has more power. <a href= http://counties.agrilife.org/gillespie/files/2015/04/EV3-Motors-Sensors-Explained-1.pdf>Lego </a> However, there is more play in the motor. As a result the rotator moves more freely and unintentionally. In order to combat this issue of moving too much, a support needs to be built.
</li>

<li>The support structure is meant to stabilize the large motor. As I was fiddling with the beams an idea came to my mind. A mid-size beam would be connected to an angled beam that is pinned to the side of the motor. This is done on the left and right side of the motor. Providing the structure a vertical standing shape, while keeping the main goal of keeping the rotating part of the motor facing upward.
</li>

 <li> The last step in this design process is to create the “arm” of the drum.  For the arm, it will be made up of  a long exle with a miniature wheel that is in the EV3 Robot box.  When connecting the axle to the motor it proved a slight challenge. Unlike a medium motor, the large motor cannot connect axles perpendicular to the motors rotator. In Order to combat this a few extra supplies were necessary to connect the axle. A few connectors/pegs and beams made it possible for the Drum to become one coherent piece.
</li>


<p>With the piece built my next step was to program so that the arm of the motor moves up and down, just like a human arm hitting a drum. All my coding was done In the EV3 Mindstorm Program. The code that was written is meant to be tentative until the piano and guitar portions are completed as well so that the drum can match with the rest of the instruments. I started off with the loop block that repeats a number of times. Followed by the large motor block establishing the rotation of the axle. The first rotation is set to 90 degrees clockwise with one second in between the second rotation going counterclockwise to end up back where it started. This motion rotated to create a fixed tempo for the song.

### Summary
<p>
I am on step 5 regarding my Engineering Design Process: creating a prototype. But even within this step, I am constantly going back and performing mini-cycle through the entire process, as seen when building my Drum. As a build I run into an issue and go over the process again: defining my issue  researching, brainstorming, planning, creating, and testing. In the weeks to come I will continue to go through this process of repeating the EDP.

But my larger prototype step is far from finished. I still have many additions to make in order for the EV3 to play a song. The next step for me is to work on the piano portion. The song that was chosen is “Mary had a little lamb”. In order to complete this section it is going to require a lot of the skills I learned as I built the drum. To help me in the process I will use this tutorial<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJToMY-3Mq4> Youtube </a> to learn how to use the color senor properly.

The recent weeks have shown me the importance of problem solving. It may seem easy to put lego pieces together to make a coherent structure but logical reasoning is definitely a skill that I am using now when building. After coming to several stops during my building process I found myself trying different possible ways to connect parts and analyzing what may work the best.  As I continue to make my EV3 Band I am looking to first make a minimum viable product and then perfect it as I go.
