#### Deciding on a Project
After receivi





















ng clearance from Mr. Mueller for using the EV3 Robot for my Freedom Project, I began gathering (and continue to do so) all necessary parts in order for the EV3 Lego Band to execute its music. The EV3 Lego Band Project


#### Tinkering

The first steps of the tinkering process consisted of hands-on work with the robot and its parts. Familiarizing myself with pieces of the EV3 robot such as the beams, gears, and axles was the first crucial step. By having an understanding of how the parts fit and interact, it allows for the building of the guitar structure needed in order for the robot to play it. In the process of organizing and tooling with the parts, I asked myself, “how will I get the EV3 robot to do all the tasks effectively?” and in asking this question I was able to establish that motors are answer and also saw what motor parts will be required for the EV3 Band to play.

***For the guitar portion:***

 <li> 1 Intelligent Block
<li>  2 EV3 Large Servo Motor
<li> 2 EV3 Medium Servo Motor

***For the melody “piano” portion:***

<li> 1 Intelligent Block
<li> 1 Color Sensor

***For the drum portion:***
Work in progress- Not yet established how it will work in relation to the rest of the band

The second half of tinkering involves familiarizing myself with the software and coding of the EV3 Robot. The LEGO
Mindstorms EV3 software is block-based coding and programming. Block based coding involves dragging “blocks” of already
declared instruction. Unlike Java it does not require typed code in order for the robot to run. When tinkering with the
blocks, especially the blocks that are connected to sensors, I noticed that each block has several  options on how it will
run, whether it is duration, length, distance etc. As a result, when building my program many times, trial and error will
be how I receive feedback on my progress and what needs to be improved
