### The Grand Finale
<p>At the start of the Freedom Project, I had created an outline of a minimum viable project. In this draft I had written that
my EV3 band would include a piano set that the piano would play the melody of a song. However, because of Covid-19 and the shut
down of schools, I am removing this part of the project because of the limited amount of lego parts that I have. As a result,
the final product will have a drum set hitting against a bowl or the guitar (to be determined), an “arm” strumming and a “hand”
pressing down to play a chord. </p>
<p>
With these adjustments, in the past few weeks I got the chance to add perfecting details to make a smooth sound from the guitar
playing. Before, the strum was choppy and the chord playing was not clear; it made a muffled sound. To make adjustments I
started with the strum. All I had to do was tweak with the software. The adjustments that I tried making included, speeding up
the speed of the beam or increasing the rotation of the swings. With some research done about controlling speed
<a href= https://makecode.mindstorms.com/reference/motors/motor/speed> Link </a>, I finally decided that decreasing speed,as a result
decreasing the force, will give me the desired sound from the strum. Next, I moved up to the neck of the guitar. An issue that I
had with this portion of the project was that when the bar-like part of the structure,( representing a finger) the sound
produced was nota clear and loud sound like if I had played it myself. While testing my programs, I noticed that when increasing
the speed of the motor also reacted with a greater force. Keeping this in mind I went on to try and increase my speed from 30%
to 50% and I did hear a slight difference in the sound the guitar was producing. The sound was not as muffled as before. </p>


### Summery

 <p> With this being my final blog entry for the EV3 Band Project, I am on step 5 in my Engineering Design Process: creating a
 prototype. But even though the project is coming to an end , I am constantly going back and performing mini-cycle through the
 entire process when I see new challenges come up or adjustments need to be made. If I run into an issue, I tweak my progress
 and go over the process again: defining my issue  researching, brainstorming, planning, creating, and testing.</p>

<p>In the last couple of days that I have I will continue to work around the “hand” of the structure to attempt and produce an even cleaner sound. In the end, I have met my final, modified, minimum viable project. This project has taught me a lot of
skills, but the one that I found most valuable was patience. This project really tested me and my patience. As I built all my
structures, there were times that I just couldn't make sense of how to put the pieces together. In these moments, I was ready to
drop all my work and just let it be and neglect the fact that it needed to be completed. When I began to become this frustrated,
I would go for a walk around the house, take a couple of deep breaths and go back to continue with a more mindful mindset. When
things got hard again, I stopped and looked at what I was doing. I wrote down what I needed to do and how I can accomplish that.
Using this system stopped me from getting extremely frustrated with the project. The more I practiced this patient mindset the
more growth i saw in myself. </p>
